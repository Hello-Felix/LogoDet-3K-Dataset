## Logo-2k+ Dataset Description
In this work, we introduce LogoDet-3K, the largest logo detection dataset with full annotation, which has 3,000 logo categories, about 200,000 manually annotated logo objects and 158,652 images. LogoDet-3K creates a more challenging benchmark for logo detection, for its higher comprehensive coverage and wider variety in both logo categories and annotated objects compared with existing datasets. 
The statistic comparison of 9 super categories from LogoDet-3K is shown as follows,

| Root Category        | Sub-Category  | Images           | Objects  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Food          |  932 |   53,350    | 64,276 |
| Clothes       |  604 |   31,266    | 37,601 |
| Necessities   |  432 |   24,822    | 30,643 |
| Others        |  371 |   15,513    | 20,016 |
| Electronic    |  224 |   9,675     | 12,139 |
|Transportation |  213 |   10,445    | 12,791 |
|Leisure        |  111 |   5,685     |  6,573 |
|Sports         |  66  |   3,945     |  5,041 |
|Medical        |  47  |   3,945     |  5,185 |
|Total          |  3,000 |   158,652 |194,261 |
